### Sunshine Station Shutdown

Automatically shutdown the Machine where [Sunshine](https://github.com/lizardbyte/Sunshine) is running on after 10 minutes if no clients are connected.

This was made in order to have a fully standalone Server with [Retroarch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) and Sunshine that can be started with Wake-On-Lan and automatically
shuts down itself when not needed.
